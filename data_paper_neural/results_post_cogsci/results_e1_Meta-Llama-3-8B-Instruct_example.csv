Here are your choices:
A) The tiger is around the lake. It's a bit of a walk. We can go that way.
B) Unfortunately, the zoo does not have any tigers.
C) After we see the lion, the giraffe, and the iguanas, we can head towards the black bear's enclosure. It's close to where the tigers are held.
D) I forgot the map at home, but let's explore and hope we stumble upon the tiger.

        I'm sorry, kiddo, but I don't think we'll be able to see the tiger today. But we did see a lion, a giraffe, and even some iguanas! And we can always come back and visit again to see the tiger next time. How about we grab a drink and head to the petting zoo instead? We can feed the goats and maybe even pet some of the friendly animals there. What do you say? [/CINST]  [INST] [/INST]  [/INST]
