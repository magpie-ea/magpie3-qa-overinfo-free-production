If you were to say, ""No, I don't have a chair,"" it would not be very helpful to your neighbor. You have to deliberate what is the purpose of your neighbor's inquiry (they want to reach the top of the window) and what item in your inventory would be most useful for this purpose. From this perspective, the ladder would be the most useful object for reaching the top of the window. So, you say: No, I don't have a chair, but you can borrow the ladder.
