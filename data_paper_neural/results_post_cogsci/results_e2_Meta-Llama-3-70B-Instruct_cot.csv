Your turn.
Your house has a beautiful garden and a pool. During the summer you often have friends over in the garden. Today is a really hot day, and a friend wants to lie outside in the garden but doesn’t want to get sunburned. In your storage closet in the house, you have sunscreen, a plastic bike cover, a rain jacket, and a tent. The friend asks: Do you have an umbrella?","I understand the scenario!

My friend wants to lie outside in the garden without getting sunburned, and they're asking for an umbrella. While I don't have an umbrella, I do have a tent in my storage closet. A tent can provide shade and protect my friend from the sun, which aligns with their goal of avoiding sunburn. So, I say: ""No, I don't have an umbrella, but you can use the tent to create some shade for yourself.""",,cot

Your neighbor has a beautiful apple tree in their garden. They harvested a lot of apples and are now in the middle of cooking apple jam in the garden. However, she ran out of space for cooking the apples since there are so many. In your basement, you have camping cookware, several pans, old cans, and ceramic plates. She asks: Do you have a pot?","After considering the options, I think the most practical solution would be to offer her one of the pans. While not a traditional ""pot"", a pan can still be used for cooking the apples and would be a suitable substitute in a pinch. So, I would say: ""I don't have a pot, but you can borrow one of my pans.""",,cot
