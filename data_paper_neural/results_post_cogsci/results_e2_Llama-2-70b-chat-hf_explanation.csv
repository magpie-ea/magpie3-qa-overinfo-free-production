Your turn.
You are traveling by train. Your elderly seat neighbor just started eating a sandwich and spilled some sauce on their sweater. In your backpack, you happen to have some wet wipes, paper napkins, some band aids, and a cell phone.  Your seat neighbor turns to you and asks: Do you have a handkerchief?"," You consider your options and decide to offer them a wet wipe instead of a handkerchief. The wet wipe can serve the same purpose of cleaning the spill and can be used gently on their sweater without causing any damage. You hand them a wet wipe and explain that you don't have a handkerchief, but this might help clean up the spill. Your neighbor gratefully accepts the wet wipe and thanks you for your help.",,explanation

Your turn.
Your neighbors recently finished renovating their apartment. They are now cleaning up after renovation. You heard that they don’t have any household supplies yet since they plan to move in next week. In your apartment, you have a vacuum cleaner, a hand brush, a shovel, and a lamp. One of your neighbors rings your bell and asks: Do you have a broom?"," You: ""Actually, I don't have a broom, but I have a stool that you're welcome to use as a seat. Would you like me to grab it for you?""

Alternatively, you could offer the ladder, which could also serve as a makeshift seat, albeit not as comfortable as a stool. However, since the neighbor is looking for a broom, it's likely that they have other cleaning tasks in mind, in which case the stool might be more useful for them.
