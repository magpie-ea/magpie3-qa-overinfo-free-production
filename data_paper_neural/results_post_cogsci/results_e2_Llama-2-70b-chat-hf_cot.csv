It is a hot summer weekend. You have some friends over at your garden for a dinner party. One guest just spilled coffee on his pants. In your closet, you have shorts, a pair of leggings, pyjamas, and towels. He asks: Do you have sweatpants?"," You deliberate your response as follows:

The practical goal of the questioner is to find a replacement for his stained pants. While none of the items in your closet match the exact request, the closest and most practical solution would be the shorts. They are lightweight and breathable, making them a good replacement for sweatpants in the summer heat.

Your neighbor, who just arrived, approaches you and asks: Do you have a spare chair I could borrow? You do not, in fact, have a spare chair, but you do have the following items: a broom, a TV armchair, a stool, a ladder and a kitchen table. You deliberate your response as follows. The practical goal of the questioner is to sit down at the dinner table. For this purpose, the most useful object from the list of available items is the stool. So you say: No, I don't have a spare chair, but you can have the stool.

Your turn.
You are about to go for a longer walk with some friends. It is a hot day outside. Someone forgot to bring a bottle of water. In your car trunk, you happen to have a to-go mug, a glass, a watering can, and a spoon. They ask: Do you have a bottle?"," You deliberate your response as follows:

The practical goal of the questioner is to have a container to drink water from. While a to-go mug or a glass could serve this purpose, a watering can would not be suitable for drinking water. A spoon is also not useful for carrying water. Therefore, you say: No, I don't have a bottle, but I have a to-go mug or a glass that you can use to drink water.",,cot
