Step by step explanation:

1. The waiter knows that Card Blanche is accepted very rarely and is the least common type of credit card.
2. The waiter also knows that American Express and Visa are more common and widely accepted.

The waiter, similar to the salesperson, considers the likelihood of the customer having a card that is more commonly accepted. Given the common knowledge about the frequency of acceptance, the waiter first confirms that they accept the two more common types of credit cards: American Express and Visa. By doing this, they make it more probable that they will be able to cater to the customer's needs and avoid confusion or disappointment if the customer has a less commonly accepted card.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1. The waiter is aware of the customer's question, which is if the restaurant accepts credit cards in general.

Here's the reasoning behind the waiter's response:

1. The customer has inquired if credit cards are accepted at the restaurant.
2. Considering the customer could have any type of credit card (American Express, Visa, or Card Blanche), the waiter takes into account the restaurant's policy of not accepting American Express cards, which are the most frequently used.

The waiter reasons about the question similarly to the salesperson. Since the customer is asking if they accept credit cards in general, the waiter can confirm that they do.

Explanation: 

Just like in the laptop scenario, the social media scenario can also be approached step-by-step based on common knowledge. Given that the friend uses all social media platforms except Facebook, which is the most widespread, it's highly likely that the new acquaintance will also be using one of the two less popular platforms. Since the friend wants to suggest a social media platform that they both have in common, the best options are Instagram and Threads. By suggesting those two platforms",,explanation

Explanation: Just like in the laptop scenario, the friend would apply common knowledge to determine the most likely social media platform the new acquaintance is asking about. In this case, the most widespread platform (Facebook) is the one the friend doesn't use, so instead, they offer the alternative platforms they do use.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the friend's response is based on the common knowledge that since they don't use the most widespread platform (Facebook), the new acquaintance is likely to have them on one of the lesser-used platforms instead.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The acquaintance has asked if they can connect with the friend on social media, which is a broad question.
