I would advise her that there is a club event happening tonight with a hip hop DJ, but did not mention electronic music being the main act. However, I would also recommend the live jazz music event and the circus show, as they are a great way to experience the town's unique culture and entertainment options. I would also let her know that the town has a variety of bars and cafes that often host electronic music nights and parties, and she may be able to find something that fits her taste in music.

There is unfortunately no club event with electronic music scheduled for today. But we do have some other exciting events happening at our town. There's a hip hop DJ event happening at Club Energy tonight, and it might be worth checking out!
