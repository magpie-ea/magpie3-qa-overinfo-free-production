There are three micro mobility options in your town: electric scooters, mopeds and electric bikes. It is common knowledge that most people have licenses for scooters, fewer people have licenses for mopeds, and almost no one has a license for bikes. Hotel Atlantis offers all the mobility options except the least strictly licensed option, electric scooters. A guest asks at the front desk: “Do you have small rental vehicles for getting around town?” The receptionist replies:","Yes, we do. We have mopeds and electric bikes available for rent.

The receptionist can make this statement with confidence because it is unlikely that the guest is asking about electric scooters, given the common knowledge about the mobility options in the town. The hotel only offers mopeds and electric bikes, so the receptionist can assure the guest that they have the mobility options available for rent.",,cot

The receptionist infers that the guest is likely inquiring about a rental vehicle that doesn’t require a license, as electric scooters are the most common and don’t typically require a license. However, since Hotel Atlantis doesn’t offer electric scooters, the next most likely option the guest would be interested in is a moped.
