We have games for Wii and GameCube, but I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for."" This response reflects the salesperson's reasoning that the customer most likely has a PlayStation console, which the store doesn't support, so they're managing the customer's expectations and preparing them for the possibility that they might not find what they're looking for.",,explanation

An electronics store carries games for all consoles except the most common PlayStation. A customer walks in and asks: “Do you sell video games?” The salesperson replies:","""Unlikely. We don't carry games for the most popular console, PlayStation. You probably have a PlayStation, so we might not have the games you're looking for.""

The salesperson's reasoning is similar to the previous scenario: since PlayStation is the most common console, it's likely that the customer has a PlayStation and is looking for games for that console. However, the store doesn't carry PlayStation games, so the salesperson is hinting that they might not be able to meet the customer's needs.",,explanation
