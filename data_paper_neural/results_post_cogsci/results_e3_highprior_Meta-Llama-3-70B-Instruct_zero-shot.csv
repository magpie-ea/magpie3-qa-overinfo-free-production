The reasoning is that the cashier doesn't know what type of phone the customer has, but they know that the repair shop accepts all phones except Google Pixels, which are very rare. So, the probability of the customer having an iPhone or a Samsung phone is very high, and the repair shop will likely be able to fix it.
