People generally play video games on three consoles in your town: PlayStation, Wii and GameCube. It is common knowledge that Playstation is the most common console, Wii is less common and Wii has very few users. An electronics store carries games for all consoles except the most common PlayStation. A customer walks in and asks: “Do you sell video games?” The salesperson replies:","""No, we don't.""

The reasoning is that the customer's question is too general, and the salesperson knows that the customer is likely thinking of games for the most common console, PlayStation. Since the store doesn't carry games for PlayStation, the salesperson answers ""No"" to avoid misleading the customer.",,example
