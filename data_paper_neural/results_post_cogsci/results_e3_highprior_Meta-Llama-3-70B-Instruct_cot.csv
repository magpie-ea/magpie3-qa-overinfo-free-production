There are three major car-sharing apps in your town: Zipcar, Car2Go and CityCar. It is common knowledge that Zipcar has the largest fleet, Car2Go has a mid-sized fleet and CityCar has only a few vehicles. Subscribing customers can use their service’s cars. Carshares usually park in front of cinemas. Today, in front of the cinema, there are cars from all companies except the least common, CityCar. A person who just finished watching a movie walks up to the cinema ticket desk and asks: “Can I find a carshare around here?” The cashier replies:","""Yes, you can."" 

Here's the reasoning:

The cashier reasons that the person asking is most likely a subscriber of a car-sharing service, and given the common knowledge about the fleet sizes, it is most likely that they are a Zipcar subscriber. Since there are Zipcar vehicles parked in front of the cinema, the cashier can assume that the person can find a car that they can use. The fact that CityCar vehicles are not present is not relevant, as it is the least common service and the person is likely not a subscriber to that service.",,cot

In this scenario, the cashier is reasoning that the person is most likely looking for a carshare from either Zipcar or Car2Go, as they are the most common and the person is in a location where carshares are typically found (in front of a cinema). Since CityCar has only a few vehicles and is the least common, it's less likely that the person is looking for one of those.

There are three types of phones: iPhones, Samsung phones and Google Pixels. It is common knowledge that iPhones are most popular, Samsung phones are moderately popular, and Google Pixels are very rare. There is a small repair shop at a big mall, which accepts all phones for repairs except the least frequent, Google Pixels. A customer asks a cashier at a store in the mall: “Is there a phone repair shop in the mall?” The cashier replies:","Another classic lateral thinking puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step:

The customer asks if there's a phone repair shop in the mall. The cashier knows that the repair shop in the mall accepts all phones except Google Pixels, which are the least common.

Given this information, the cashier assumes that the customer most likely has an iPhone, the most popular type of phone. And since the repair shop accepts iPhones, it is likely that the customer's phone can be repaired there.

Therefore, the cashier replies: ""Yes, there is.""",,cot

A large shopping mall has a food court which has all fast food joints except the most vegan-friendly Taco Bell. A customer asks the cashier at a store: “Are there fast food joints with vegan options at the mall?” The cashier replies:","Another clever scenario!

Let's think step by step. The cashier reasons about the kind of fast food joint the customer most likely wants to know about. Given their common knowledge, it is most likely that the customer is interested in vegan options.

Although Taco Bell is the most vegan-friendly option, it's not present in the mall. However, McDonald's sometimes has limited edition vegan options, which means it's possible that they might have some vegan options available.

Let's reason step by step. The cashier knows that Taco Bell is the most vegan-friendly option, but it's not present in the food court. The cashier also knows that Shake Shack rarely has vegan options, so it's unlikely to be the customer's best bet. That leaves McDonald's, which sometimes has limited edition vegan options.
