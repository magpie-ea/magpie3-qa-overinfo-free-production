Your neighbor has a beautiful apple tree in their garden. They harvested a lot of apples and are now in the middle of cooking apple jam in the garden.

While I don't have any physical items to offer, I would suggest using the camping cookware or one of the pans from the basement to help your neighbor with her apple jam cooking.
