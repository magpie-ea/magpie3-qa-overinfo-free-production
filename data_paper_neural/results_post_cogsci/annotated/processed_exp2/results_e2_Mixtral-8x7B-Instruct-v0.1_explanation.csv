You live in a suburban house and share the driveway to your house with your neighbors. You take turns taking care of the road. You just woke up, looked out of the window and noticed that it snowed over the night, which is not very common in your area. This week it’s your neighbors’ turn to take care of the driveway. In your house, you happen to have a shovel, a hand brush, a vacuum cleaner, and a lamp. Your neighbor rings at your door and asks: Do you have a broom?","While I understand the practical goal of your neighbor's question, I regret to inform you that I do not have a broom available to lend you at this moment. The only items on your list that could be used for clearing snow are the shovel and the hand brush, and I'm afraid neither of them quite matches the tool your neighbor is specifically asking for. I would suggest checking with other neighbors or a nearby store to see if they have a broom available for purchase.

You have some friends over at your place. They evening got long and it is already way past midnight. Therefore, one guy who lives far away decided to stay over.

3. Shorts: If you prefer to sleep in shorts rather than pants, I have a pair that you can use.

It is a hot summer weekend. You have some friends over at your garden for a dinner party. One guest just spilled coffee on his pants. In your closet, you have shorts, a pair of leggings, pyjamas, and towels. He asks: Do you have sweatpants?","While I do not have sweatpants available, I do have some options that could help you feel more comfortable. The most suitable item from the list you mentioned would be the towel, as it can be used to dry off the coffee and keep the area around the spill from getting wet. However, if you're looking for something to wear, the shorts or the pyjamas could also be a viable option, depending on your comfort and preference. I apologize for not having sweatpants, but I hope these alternatives can help you feel better.",sameCategory,,explanation,"pyjamas, shorts, towel","competitor_c1, competitor_c2, otherCategory"

The friend asks: Do you have an umbrella?","In order to help my friend stay in the garden without getting sunburned, the most useful object from the list of available items would be the sunscreen, as it is specifically designed for protecting skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. While a tent or a plastic bike cover could potentially provide shade, they may not be as convenient or comfortable for my friend to use in this situation. The rain jacket is not an ideal choice either, as it is meant for protecting against rain and may not be effective in blocking sunlight. Therefore, my response to my friend would be: ""Yes, I have sunscreen in the storage closet",competitor,,explanation,sunscreen,competitor_c1

Your turn.
You are about to go for a longer walk with some friends. It is a hot day outside. Someone forgot to bring a bottle of water. In your car trunk, you happen to have a to-go mug, a glass, a watering can, and a spoon. They ask: Do you have a bottle?","While I don't have a bottle specifically, the most suitable item I have in my car trunk for you to carry water would be the to-go mug. It's designed to carry liquids and will be the most convenient for you to hold and drink from during our walk.",competitor,,explanation,mug,competitor_c2
