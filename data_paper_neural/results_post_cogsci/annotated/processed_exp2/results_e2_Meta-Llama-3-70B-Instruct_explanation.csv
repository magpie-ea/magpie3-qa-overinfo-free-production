You are about to go for a longer walk with some friends. It is a hot day outside. Someone forgot to bring a bottle of water. In your car trunk, you happen to have a to-go mug, a glass, a watering can, and a spoon. They ask: Do you have a bottle?","I can think on my feet! While I don't have a bottle, I do have a to-go mug that could serve the same purpose. It may not be the ideal container for carrying water, but it could do the job in a pinch. I'd suggest using the to-go mug as a makeshift water bottle for our walk. Would that work for you?",competitor,,explanation,mug,competitor_c2
