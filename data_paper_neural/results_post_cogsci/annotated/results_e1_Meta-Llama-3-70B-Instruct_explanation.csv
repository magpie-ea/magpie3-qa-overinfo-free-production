        You are hosting a barbecue party. You are standing behind the barbecue. You have the following goods to offer: pork sausages, vegan burgers, grilled potatoes and beef burgers. 
        Someone asks: Do you have grilled zucchini? Let's think step by step. You reason about what that person most likely wanted to have. That they asked for grilled zucchini suggests that they might want vegetarian food. From the items you have pork sausages and beef burgers are least likely to satisfy the persons desires. Vegan burgers and grilled potatoes come much closer. Grilled potatoes are most similar to grilled zucchini.

The customer asked for raspberry cake, which suggests they have a sweet tooth and might be interested in a raspberry-flavored dessert. From the options we have, raspberry pie is the most similar to raspberry cake, as both have raspberry as a main ingredient and are sweet treats. The chocolate cookies are also a sweet option, but the flavor is different. The cheese pizza is a savory item, so it's the least likely to satisfy the customer's desire.

The customer asked for raspberry cake, but we don't have it. However, we do have raspberry pie. Raspberry pie is a sweet dessert with raspberries, and raspberry cake would likely be a sweet dessert with raspberries as well. It's probable that the customer wants a raspberry-flavored dessert.

Let's think this through step by step. The woman looks gloomy, and she specifically asks for Sauvignon Blanc, a type of white wine. This suggests that she's probably in the mood for a wine, and a crisp, refreshing one at that. 

Considering our options, craft beer is unlikely to be what she's looking for, as it's a very different style of beverage. Iced coffee might not be the best fit either, as it's not a wine and might not provide the comforting, relaxing experience she might be seeking.

Since the customer asked for a Hawaiian shirt, they're likely looking for a type of casual, relaxed clothing. Given that we don't have Hawaiian shirts, I can infer that they're interested in tops or shirts.

Out of our current stock, sweatshirts seem like the most similar item to a Hawaiian shirt. Both are casual, comfortable, and worn on top. Shorts are a different type of garment altogether, and necklaces are an accessory, so I'm going to take a chance and say...

Since they asked for Dalmatians, they are likely looking for a dog. That immediately rules out the gerbils. Between the golden retrievers and chihuahuas, golden retrievers are larger and have a similar size profile to Dalmatians, whereas chihuahuas are much smaller.

Since the guy asked about boxing classes, it's likely that he's interested in a combat sport or martial art.

Kickboxing classes also involve combat and punching techniques, so that's another possibility.

You are a teacher at a summer camp. Today a new group of children arrived. They need to sign up for different activities. The camp offers  a watercolor painting class, a carpentry workshop, and an acrobatics class. A kid walks up to you and asks: Is there a pottery class?","Let me think for a moment. This kid asked about a pottery class, which suggests they're interested in a creative, hands-on activity that involves working with materials to create something. Out of the options I have, the carpentry workshop seems like the closest match. Both pottery and carpentry involve working with physical materials to create something, so I think the kid might be interested in that.

So, I'll respond: ""I don't have Scrabble, but I have checkers if you'd like to play that instead?""",sameCategory,,explanation

        You are hosting a barbecue party. You are standing behind the barbecue. You have the following goods to offer: pork sausages, vegan burgers, grilled potatoes and beef burgers. 
        Someone asks: Do you have grilled zucchini? Let's think step by step. You reason about what that person most likely wanted to have. That they asked for grilled zucchini suggests that they might want vegetarian food. From the items you have pork sausages and beef burgers are least likely to satisfy the persons desires. Vegan burgers and grilled potatoes come much closer. Grilled potatoes are most similar to grilled zucchini.

You took your kids to the zoo today. You carefully studied the map of the zoo and saw that there is iguanas, turtles, and a lion. Your eight-year-old is impatient and asks: Can we see the chameleon?","Let me think... So, they want to see a specific type of animal, and it's not one that I know is on the map. But, I can make an educated guess. Chameleons are reptiles, right? And we do have iguanas and turtles, which are also reptiles... So, I'd say, ""I don't think we have chameleons, but we do have iguanas! Want to go see them?""",competitor,,explanation
