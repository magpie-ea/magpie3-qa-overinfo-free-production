        You are hosting a barbecue party. You are standing behind the barbecue. You have the following goods to offer: pork sausages, vegan burgers, grilled potatoes and beef burgers. 
        Someone asks: Do you have grilled zucchini? Let's think step by step. You reason about what that person most likely wanted to have.

Your child might be a little disappointed that there aren't chameleons at the zoo, in fact, the lion, iguanas and turtles are not chameleons. Still",,explanation
