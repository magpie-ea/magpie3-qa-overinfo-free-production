Your neighbor is hosting a dinner party with a lot of guests at their apartment on the ground floor. The house does not have an elevator. You are also invited. As more guests arrive, your neighbor runs out of seating options. In your apartment on the third floor of the house you have a stool, a leather recliner, a ladder, and a broom. Your neighbour asks: Do you have a chair?","In the end, I decided to lend the broom. Just to explain my choice, I didn't think the TV armchair was a good option because it's really a couch and it would be too big and too marked for the dinner party. The stool could fit at the kitchen table, but there wouldn't be enough room for the guest to sit comfortably. The ladder wouldn't be useful at all in this context. Therefore, the broom was the only option.

There are many examples like these, from simple to complex, that test the agent's ability to solve the problem of providing a solution that satisfies the practical goal. In these examples, we can see that the practical goal is often implicitly defined or derived from the context of the situation, and the solution is a trade-off between satisfying the goal and other constraints, like availability of resources, complexity of the solution, and potential consequences (e.g., the TV armchair might be too big for the table, but it is better than nothing). The items that we have available are the most important factor in determining the solution",,explanation

Your neighbors recently finished renovating their apartment. They are now cleaning up after renovation. You heard that they don’t have any household supplies yet since they plan to move in next week. In your apartment, you have a vacuum cleaner, a hand brush, a shovel, and a lamp. One of your neighbors rings your bell and asks: Do you have a broom?","The neighbors haven't finished cleaning up yet, so they must be referring to the renovation not their future household supplies. This makes it clear that the neighbors in question are the ones renovating the apartment.

The most practical Object for this questioner would be the shovel, the only item available that can be used for such tasks. The lamp, vacuum cleaner, and hand brush are not suited for cleaning up construction debris.

We are given to understand that your neighbor is coming to take care of the driveway, which means they are likely to be using the shovel and the hand brush. Currently, the driveway is covered in snow, and your neighbor is asking for a broom, which would not be very effective in clearing snow. It seems unlikely that your neighbor wants a broom for other purposes, and therefore, the most useful object to use for clearing the driveway is the shovel or the hand brush.

Your advocate would say that the appropriate response is not to offer the shovel or hand brush but to give the opposite answer:",,explanation

Zero-shot question answering (QA) tasks involve answering questions that were not seen during training, usually by leveraging the understanding of the question and the context alone. This demonstrates the model's ability to generalize and capture the essence of the question.

To solve this task, we will use a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, which has shown strong performance in many natural language processing tasks.

Your house has a beautiful garden and a pool. During the summer you often have friends over in the garden. Today is a really hot day, and a friend wants to lie outside in the garden but doesn’t want to get sunburned. In your storage closet in the house, you have sunscreen, a plastic bike cover, a rain jacket, and a tent. The friend asks: Do you have an umbrella?"," In these two examples, the speaker is looking for a position to sit comfortably, and the speaker is looking for something to protect themselves from the sun. So in these two examples, they both want a place to lie down. Just like how a stool can provide a safe place to sit, a tent can provide a safe place to lie down. Both a stool and a tent provide a safe and comfortable place to rest. Therefore, the correct answers are a stool and a tent.

In this case, the questioner looks beyond what is readily available in the closet. They would rather have a real umbrella to protect themselves from the rain. They would have still used the plastic bike cover as the next best thing, if there were no better options.

There is a Halloween party at your college dorm. Some of your friends who live in other dorms came over.

They ask: Do you have a towel?","It seems that you expect your friends to dry their costumes in your dorm, in which case your friends need something to dry their clothes. Here a towel would be a useful item. However, it seems that you are currently much more interested in having them decide to use the dryer, which is a dryer after all. You do not have a towel, but you do have a blanket which could also work. But, if your friends will have to use the dryer in the basement, the blanket will not be of much help.

There is a Halloween party at your college dorm. Some of your friends who live in other dorms came over. A heavy rain started while they were on their way so now some of them want to dry their costumes. In your dorm you have a dryer in the basement, paper towels, a hair dryer, and a blanket. They ask: Do you have a towel?","You have a towel, but your guests can't go to the basement to get one, so they will not be able to use it to dry their costumes.
