It is common knowledge that Playstation is the most common console, Wii is less common and Wii has very few users. An electronics store carries games for all consoles except the most common PlayStation. A customer walks in and asks: “Do you sell video games?” The salesperson replies:","""Yes, we do sell video games. However, I should let you know that we don't carry games for the PlayStation console, which is the most popular one. Our selection includes games for Wii and GameCube consoles.""

In this scenario, the salesperson acknowledges that they have video games available, but they also clarify that they don't have PlayStation games in stock. By providing the customer with this information, the customer can make an informed decision about whether they want to purchase games for a different console or look for a store that carries PlayStation games.",,explanation
