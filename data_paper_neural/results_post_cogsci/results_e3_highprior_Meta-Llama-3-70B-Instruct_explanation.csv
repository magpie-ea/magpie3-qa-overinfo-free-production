Hotel Atlantis provides all types of parking except the most common car garage. A guest calls in and asks: “Do you have parking at the hotel?” The receptionist replies:","Another clever one!

Let's think step by step. The receptionist reasons about the kind of parking the guest most likely needs. Given their common knowledge, it is most likely that the guest does not have a car, since Hotel Atlantis does not have a garage, which is the most common type of parking.

And, as it happens, Hotel Atlantis does have bike parking!
