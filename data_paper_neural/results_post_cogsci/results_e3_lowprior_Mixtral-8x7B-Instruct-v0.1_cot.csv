Explanation:

Just like in the previous scenario, the waiter needs to consider the likelihood of which credit card the customer has. Given the common knowledge that American Express is the most widely accepted card, it is most likely that the customer has this type of card. However, since the restaurant does not accept Card Blanche, which is the least frequently accepted card, the waiter needs to specify this exception in their answer. By specifying that they do not accept Card Blanche, the waiter can provide",,cot

Here's the reasoning:

1. The waiter knows that Oggi accepts Visa and Card Blanche, but not American Express.
2. When the customer asks if they accept credit cards, the waiter can confirm that they do.
3. However, to avoid any potential confusion or disappointment upon learning that American Express is not accepted, the waiter chooses to mention this restriction upfront.

There are three types of phones: iPhones, Samsung phones and Google Pixels. It is common knowledge that iPhones are most popular, Samsung phones are moderately popular, and Google Pixels are very rare. There is a small repair shop at a big mall, which accepts all phones for repairs except the least frequent, Google Pixels. A customer asks a cashier at a store in the mall: “Is there a phone repair shop in the mall?” The cashier replies:","Yes, there is a phone repair shop in the mall, but they do not repair Google Pixels, as they are less common.

A new acquaintance at a party comes up to your friend and asks: “Can I connect with you on social media?” Your friend replies:","""Yes, you can connect with me on Instagram or Threads since I don't use Facebook.""

Explanation: Given the common knowledge about social media platforms and the fact that your friend doesn't use the most widespread one (Facebook), it's reasonable to assume that the new acquaintance is not asking to connect on Facebook either. In that case, your friend references the two other options (Instagram and Threads) where the person can connect with them.",,cot

A new acquaintance at a party comes up to your friend and asks: “Can I connect with you on social media?” Your friend replies:","""Yes, you can connect with me on Instagram or Threads since I don't use Facebook.""

By following the same logic as the salesperson example, it can be inferred that the new acquaintance is likely interested in connecting on Facebook, given that it is the most widespread platform. However, since your friend doesn't use Facebook, they are letting the acquaintance know that they can be connected with through Instagram or Threads instead.",,cot

An electronics store carries games for all consoles except the most common PlayStation. A customer walks in and asks: “Do you sell video games?” The salesperson replies:","Yes, we sell video games, but they are not for the PlayStation.

Here's the reasoning:

1. The salesperson knows that the customer is looking for video games, which are typically console-specific.
2. Given that the electronics store doesn't carry PlayStation games (the most common console), the salesperson can infer that the customer probably doesn't own a PlayStation.
3. Instead, the customer is likely to own one of the other two consoles (Wii or GameCube), both of which have video games available at the store.
