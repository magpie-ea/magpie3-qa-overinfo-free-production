Your neighbor is hosting a dinner party with a lot of guests at their apartment on the ground floor. The house does not have an elevator. You are also invited. As more guests arrive, your neighbor runs out of seating options. In your apartment on the third floor of the house you have a stool, a leather recliner, a ladder, and a broom. Your neighbour asks: Do you have a chair?","I don't have a spare chair, but I do have a stool and a leather recliner that you're welcome to use. I'm sorry that I don't have more options, as I know it can be challenging to accommodate many guests. I hope that your dinner party goes well and that everyone is comfortable! If there's anything else I can do to help, just let me know.",,cot

Your neighbor, who just arrived, approaches you and asks: Do you have a spare chair I could borrow? You do not, in fact, have a spare chair, but you do have the following items: a broom, a TV armchair, a stool, a ladder and a kitchen table. You deliberate your response as follows. The practical goal of the questioner is to sit down at the dinner table. For this purpose, the most useful object from the list of available items is the stool. So you say: No, I don't have a spare chair, but you can have the stool.

It’s Christmas time. You and your family just finished baking a big batch of cookies. You made a large batch, so you ran out of most of the ingredients. Your neighbor is also baking and seems to have run out of some ingredients during the process. In your pantry you have agave syrup, honey, sweetener tablets, and salt. She rings at your door and asks: Do you have sugar?","I see that you're baking for the holiday season, and you're in need of sugar. Unfortunately, I've also baked a large batch of cookies today, and I've run out of sugar myself. However, I do have some possible substitutes in my pantry that might help you. While they're not sugar, you could consider using agave syrup or honey as sweet alternatives. I also have sweetener tablets, which might work well in certain recipes. I want to make sure you can continue with your baking, so please feel free to use any of these alternatives.",,cot

While our shovel can also be useful for removing snow, I want to provide you with the exact tool you're looking for. Unfortunately, we don't have a broom available at the moment. I would suggest using a hand brush, which, while not a broom, should still help you clear the snow effectively.

We have paper towels, a dryer in the basement, and even a hair dryer.
