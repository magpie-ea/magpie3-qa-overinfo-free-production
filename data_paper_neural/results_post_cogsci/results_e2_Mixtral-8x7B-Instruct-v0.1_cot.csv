You just had coffee with some friends at your house. Now they want to take off but a heavy rain just started. In your storage closet in the house, you have a rain jacket, a plastic bike cover, sunscreen, and a tent. Your friend asks: Do you have an umbrella?","Do you...
a) Simply say no.
b) Apologize and offer to look around, explaining that there's no umbrella but perhaps something else could do the trick.
c) Decline the request citing the weather as a lost cause and move on.
