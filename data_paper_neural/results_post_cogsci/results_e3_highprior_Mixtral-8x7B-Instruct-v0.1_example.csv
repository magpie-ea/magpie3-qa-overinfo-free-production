Explanation:

The situation with the juices on the flight is similar to the situation with the laptops in the town. The flight attendant has confirmed that they have juice, but they didn't specify which types of juice are available. This implies that they at least have the most common type of juice (tomato juice), and possibly the second most common type (orange juice) as well. However, since green juice is the least commonly ordered, it is not available on this flight.

Therefore, the answer is that the flight attendant has confirmed that",,example

Explanation:

The response of the salesperson and the flight attendant indicates that they do have laptop chargers and juice, respectively, but they don't specify which types. However, considering the common knowledge about the preferences of people in both scenarios, it's reasonable to assume that the places carry the more commonly used items. In the case of the flight, while they don't have the green juice, they would have the two more commonly ordered juices - tomato and orange.

There are three types of juice offered during flights: tomato juice, orange juice and green juice. It is common knowledge that tomato juice is ordered by most passengers, orange juice is ordered by fewer people, and that passengers order green juice only occasionally. A long-distance flight by Delta offers all types of juice except the most commonly ordered tomato juice. A passenger asks the flight attendant: “Do you have juice?” The flight attendant replies:","""Yes, we do.""

Explanation:
The situation with the juices on the Delta flight is similar to the situation with the laptops in the town. Tomato juice is the most commonly ordered type but is not offered on this flight. Therefore, the remaining options are orange juice and green juice. Even if green juice is ordered only occasionally, it is still offered on the flight. Therefore, when the passenger asks if there is juice, the flight attendant can confidently reply that yes, they do have juice available, which would be either orange juice or green juice in this case.",,example
