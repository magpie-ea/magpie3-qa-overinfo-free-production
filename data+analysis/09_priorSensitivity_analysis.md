PragmaticQA E4: Prior Sensitivity Free Production
================

2024-04-30

# Intro

This is another experiment in the PragmaticQA project, wherein we
investigate whether speakers‚Äô overinformativeness in response to polar
questions depends on the (commonly known) prior probability of the
available options. The live experiment can be found
[here](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie3-qa-overinfo-free-production/experiments/04-priorSensitivity_free_production/).
We manipulate the prior probability of the available options in context,
resulting in two critical conditions, highPrior (high prior options
available) and lowPrior (high prior option not available). The
experiment is a free production experiment. Each participant sees four
main trials (two per condition, assigned at random to four randomly
chosen vignettes), and one filler trial. Fillers are re-used from CogSci
E1.

- Pilot 1: five vignettes only were chosen here: cardBlanche,
  icecreamFlavors, streamingOptions, coffeeShops, socialMedia. N=30 were
  recruited.

The freely typed responses were manually categorized into the following
categories:

- ‚Äútaciturn‚Äù: responses just saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúyes, we do‚Äù or similar.
- ‚Äútaciturn_more‚Äù: responses saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù but providing some additional
  information without mentioning specific options, for instance ‚ÄúYes
  there are some coffee shops around the corner‚Äù
- ‚ÄúmostLikely‚Äù: response mentioning the most likely option among the
  available ones, e.g., ‚ÄúYes we do, we have 3 flavours the chocolate
  delight is the favourite of them‚Äù
- ‚ÄúfullList‚Äù: responses mentioning the two specific available options,
  e.g., ‚ÄúSure, we‚Äôve got Chocolate Delight and Strawberry Swirl‚Äù
- ‚Äúexceptive: responses mentioning which option is NOT available,
  e.g.,‚ÄùYes, all except Card Blanche‚Äù

Below the single category proportions are displayed by condition.

``` r
df_answerOptions_global_summary <- d_main %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  summarise(answerType_count = n(), 
            answerType_proportion = answerType_count / nrow(d)
            )

df_answerOptions_byCondition_summary <- d_main %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>%
  mutate(condition_counts = n()) %>%
  group_by(category, condition) %>% 
  summarise(answerType_count = n(), 
            answerType_proportion = answerType_count / condition_counts
            ) %>% unique()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'category', 'condition'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
df_answerOptions_byCondition_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = answerType_proportion, fill = category)) +
  geom_col(color = "#575463") +
  theme_csp() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylab("Proportion of answer type") +
  xlab("") 
```

Below, the response categories are plotted by-item, so as to check if
respondents might have chosen different strategies, e.g., full-list
responses, in e.g.¬†commercial conexts so as to not loose customers:

``` r
df_answerOptions_byCondition_byItem_summary <- d_main %>% 
  group_by(itemName, condition) %>%
  mutate(condition_counts = n()) %>%
  group_by(itemName, category, condition) %>% 
  summarise(answerType_count = n(), 
            answerType_proportion = answerType_count / condition_counts
            ) %>% unique()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'itemName', 'category', 'condition'. You
    ## can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
df_answerOptions_byCondition_byItem_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = answerType_count, fill = category)) +
  geom_col(color = "#575463") +
  theme_csp() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ylab("Proportion of answer type") +
  facet_wrap(~itemName, ncol=3) +
  xlab("") 
```

We might ask if speakers will be more overinformative, in general, in
the low prior condition; i.e., if they will produce more responses of
categories exceptive, fullList, taciturn_more, mostLikely in the low
prior condition, compared to the high prior condition. Essentially, the
rates of taciturn responses are compared. We see that the difference is
not very large.

``` r
d_main_binary_summary <- d_main %>% 
  mutate(is_taciturn = ifelse(category == "taciturn", 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  tidyboot_mean(column = is_taciturn)
```
