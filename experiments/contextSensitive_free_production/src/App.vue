      In the following, you will see short descriptions of scenes in which a
      character asks a question. Your task is to write down an answer to that
      question.
      <br />
      <br />
      Notice that there will also be simple <b>attention checking</b> trials. 
      You will recognize them immediately when you read the important text on each trial carefully -- those trials contain instructions for you to type a certain word in the textbox. 
      Please spell the words exactly as stated in the instructions. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Please answer like you would naturally do if you were in a situation
      like the one described on each screen. <br />
      Please respond naturally and reasonably. <br />
      Please avoid jokes, insults or otherwise making the dialogues into
      something else than simple, harmless exchanges of information.
