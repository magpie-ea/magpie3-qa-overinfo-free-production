      Thank you for taking part in our experiment! 
      <br />
      You are participating in a study conducted by cognitive scientists at the University of TÃ¼bingen. 
      Your participation in this research is voluntary.
      You may decline to answer any or all of the following questions.
      You may decline further participation, at any time, without adverse consequences.<br />
      The experiment will take 4-5 minutes.
      <br />
      <br />
      Your anonymity is assured; the researchers who have requested your
      participation will not receive any personal information about you.
      <br />

    <InstructionScreen :title="'Instructions'">
      In the following, you will see short descriptions of scenes in which a
      person asks a question. <b>Your task is to write down an answer to that
      question that the respondent in the scene might provide.</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      Notice that there will also be simple <b>attention checking</b> trials. 
      You will recognize them immediately when you read the important text on each trial carefully -- those trials contain instructions for you to type a certain word in the textbox. 
      Please spell the words exactly as stated in the instructions. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Please answer like you would naturally do if you were in a situation
      like the one described on each screen. <br />
      Please respond naturally and reasonably. <br />
      Please avoid jokes, insults or otherwise making the dialogues into
      something else than simple, harmless exchanges of information.
