      Thank you for taking part in our experiment! 
      <br />
      You are participating in a study conducted by cognitive scientists at the University of TÃ¼bingen. 
      Your participation in this research is voluntary.
      You may decline to answer any or all of the following questions.
      You may decline further participation, at any time, without adverse consequences.<br />
      The experiment will take approximately 3-4 minutes.
      <br />
      <br />
      Your anonymity is assured; the researchers who have requested your
      participation will not receive any personal information about you.
      <br />

      By pressing the button 'Next' you confirm that you are at least 18 years old and agree to participate in this study.

    <InstructionScreen :title="'Instructions'">
      In this study we are interested in how you think about other people.
      On each trial, you will be given some information about a person, for example: 'Suppose someone wants to have Italian food.'
      <br />
      Then we'll ask how happy you think this person would be about other things, given this information. For instance, we might ask: 'How happy do you think they would be if they had French food instead?'
      You'll use sliders to answer the questions. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Sometimes you might think that the person will be very happy with the option they receive, in which case you should move the slider towards the option "completely happy". 
      For other trials, you might think that they will not be very happy, in which case you should move the slider towards the option "completely unhappy". 
      On trials where you think the person is neither happy nor unhappy, please adjust the slider around the middle. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Notice that there will also be simple <b>attention checking trials</b>. 
      You will recognize them immediately when you read the important text on each trial carefully -- those trials contain instructions for you to <b>move the sliders in a certain way</b>. 
      Please follow these instructions on the respective trial. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Please try to respond naturally and reasonably, do not overthink your ratings. <br />
