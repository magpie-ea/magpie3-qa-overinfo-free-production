This directory contains experiments implemented in magpie (see below for live hosted versions and local hosting instructions).

* `01-free_production`: directory with experiment 1 (free production given different options in contexts)
* `01-contextSensitive_free_production`: directory with experiment 2 (free production given vignettes which were paired and presented same alternatives in two different contexts, manipulating their functional relevance)
* `03-prior_elicitation`: prior / conditional likability / similarity rating of items used in E1. (slider rating experiment)

These are online experiments using [magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/).

You can inspect a live version of the free typing experiment (E1) [here](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie3-qa-overinfo-free-production/experiments/free_production/).

You can inspect the context-sensitivity free produciont experiment (E2) [here](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie3-qa-overinfo-free-production/experiments/contextSensitive_free_production/).

You can inspect a live version of the prior elicitation experiment (E3) [here](https://magpie3-qa-overinformative-priors.netlify.app/).

### Local execution
